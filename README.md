Creates an ML Pipeline leveraging PySpark SQL and PySpark MLib to predict airfoils noise levels. 

This repository contains Data Engineering and ML material completed to obtain the [Data Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/e0a1b78c-db53-484c-8363-2da95ba0582a) and the
[Machine Learning with Apache Spark Certification](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/886943d9-1bda-45b)
offered by IBM.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                               
The project aims to create an ML Pipeline from a data engineer perspective at an aeronautics consulting company
that designs airfoils for use in planes and sports cars. In this project, the                                  
[NASA Airfoil Self Noise](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/291/airfoil+self+noise) dataset was used.        
The dataset was cleaned, and a data ML pipeline was created to evaluate the model that will predict the        
SoundLevel-based in multivariate data. The models were evaluated and persisted.                                
                                                                                                               
                                                                                                               
While the dataset and some parts of the ML pipeline structure are preserved, the notebook here is updated to work with ```PySpark version 3.5.3```.
The pipeline can be run using ```Final_Project.ipynb``` or ```main.py``` on the terminal.
